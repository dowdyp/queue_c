# Simple DEQueue in C
Written for Exam 1 Part B in Operating Systems COMP3400

### Implementation
The queue uses a doubly-linked struct `q_node`, and keeps track of the `head` and `tail` of the queue within the main function. Currently there is no way to accept user input in order to actively modify queue contents.
